The script is written in bash and is named as bash_scripting.sh. The script takes exactly two filenames as arguments. If exactly two names are not provided, the script prints a usage message and exits, otherwise the script does what is described next. 
The usage message tells the user how to use the script. The script checks whether the input file exists or not. If the input file does not exist, the script generates an appropriate error message and exits. If the input file exists, then the script proceeds to the next step.
